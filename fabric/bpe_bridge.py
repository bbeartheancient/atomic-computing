"""BPE bridge for the OpenCode shim (NeoHarness state in OpenCode's loop).

OpenCode manages its own context and compacts client-side; when the
summary drops running state the session gets lost (measured: the WELDING
session ran 10.4M cumulative tokens without persisting one fact; the
NeoHarness long-horizon bench shows raw loops fail 0/3 under forced
elision where BPE externalization passes).  This bridge injects the BPE
harness into the shim's verbatim forward:

  - INJECT: a compact protocol cheat-sheet + the session's rendered
    H_t = (Belief, Progress, Experience) appended to the first system
    message of every non-compaction request (capped at
    FABRIC_OPENCODE_BPE_CHARS, default 1500).  After a compaction the
    next request gets a "context was compacted" banner plus any pending
    harness answers.
  - APPLY: <action>commit/note/track/recall</action> blocks in the
    assistant reply are dispatched against the per-session BPE state
    (persisted per session under NEOH_STATE_DIR) — the tags pass through
    to OpenCode harmlessly (rendered as text); the state they write is
    what survives the next compaction.
  - track/recall answers ride back in the NEXT request's injection
    (pending-answer queue), closing the read path.

State lives in NeoHarness (imported, not vendored: NEOH_ROOT env,
default /home/bbear/NeoHarness).  Fail-soft everywhere: if NeoHarness is
unavailable the bridge disables itself and the shim behaves exactly as
before.  Gate: FABRIC_OPENCODE_BPE=1 (drop-in 65-opencode-bpe.conf).

### Harness (persistent state across compaction)
You may add ONE harness action per reply, written EXACTLY like this —
the <action> tags are required:
  <action>commit[subgoal | pending|attempted|done|blocked]</action>
  <action>note[general|task|mistake|prior | insight]</action>
  <action>track[world]</action>  <action>recall[query]</action>
The action is recorded outside the transcript and SURVIVES context
compaction; track/recall answers arrive with the next turn.
After any compaction, re-orient from the injected state BEFORE continuing.
Commit running totals/progress to the harness or to the project's state
file as you go — never let verified facts live only in this conversation."""
